DONE. fix the task component's select elements so they will show the newest value on re-render.
Perhaps replace the select with a label? I want the editing to be separate from the display?
This seems the easier fix and it fits better with the current approach anyway. DONE.

Separate the add form into a button that opens a modal or something.

Style:
Add task background color by priority
