-store, reducer, dispatch, useDispatch, selector, useSelector

-redux itself is a js library. It is used in react.


<Provider store={store}>
    <SomeElement />
</Provider>

//this is the store
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import todosReducer from './reducers/TodoReducer';

export const store = createStore(todosReducer);

todosReducer holds the handler functions

todosReducer receives the current state and an "action" object specifying
what to change in that state.

the dispatch receives and "action" object. The action object may receive some payload.

the dispatch searches for the closest ancestor provider and passes the "action" to it's reducer.

the reducer then updates the state according to the action passed and it's payload(if present).
